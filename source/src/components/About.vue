		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Artur, I live in Poland. I'm 19 years old and I love programming
			I spend the most time in Node.js/webdev. I can also write something in Python, PHP and C++.
			I have many projects that have never been finished, you can check them out on my
			<a href='https://github.com/wilkoklak'>GitHub page</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			My second passion is music. I play guitar for few years, however it was not so
			long ago since I've started to really learn scales, technique etc.
			I love blues, rock and grunge. Currently I worship Jimi Hendrix, he still amazes me
